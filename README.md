#### Description

----
    
    This is a AngularJS project designed to create an editable and updated character sheet for Fate Core sheets. 
    Geared mainly toward the Dresden Files RPG system, this is supposed to help people create their physical sheets and 
    assist in stress track calculation, and eventual magic spell creation ( so it can be done quickly on the fly )
